# **Getting and Cleaning Data** project codebook

This codebook decribes the dataset that can be found in `tidy_data.txt` in this repo.
For more information on the data, please view the `README.md` in the reppo. 
This codebook describes the measured and ID variables along with a brief description on the data.
## Data 
In the file named `tidy_data.txt` some space separated values can be found. Variable names can be found at the first row. More information on the data can be found in `README.md` 
## ID Variables 
There are two ID variables for the data: `id` and `activity`. `id` relates to the number of the subject in the study, there were 30 subjets. The study carried out on 30 subjects carrying the smartphone while performing everyday life activities. The other ID variable in the dataset is `activity`. `activity` notes the physical activity of the subject at the pertaining row in the dataset. Activities recorded are:
 
	1. `WALKING`
	2. `WALKING_UPSTAIRS`
	3. `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS`
	4. `SITTING`
	5. `STANDING`
	6. `LAYING`
## Measured variables
There are two different types of measured variables in the dataset: 
- Time-domain: These variables can be recognised by `time` in the begining of the variable name. These variables are generated by the  accelerometer and gyroscope.
- Frequency-domain: These variables can be recognised by `frequency` in the begining of the variable name. These variables are results of applying Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to a number of time-domain variables.

There are also two different functions that were applied to the raw data that can be recognised by `mean` denoting mathematical average of the values and `standard.deviation` mentioning the standard deviation of the variable.

### Measured variables description
A list of variables can be seen below. Variables are either averages of `mean` or averages of `standard.deviation`. As can be seen, the name of variables is self-explanatory. For example, `time.body.acceleration.jerk.standard.deviation.x` is the average of body jerk standard deviation with respect to x axis in time domain; or `frequency.body.gyroscope.magnitude.mean.freq` is the body gyroscopic precision magnitude after the furier transformation in frequensy domain.

## Performed Transformations 

The code downloads the data, if not avaible in working directory, and then applies the following transformation on the messy dataset.

1. Names the columns of test and train datasets.
2. Merges test and train datasets
3. Renames the activity values to the activity labels so dataset is more readable.
4. Extracts those columns whoes names contain "mean" or "std"
5. Column names are modified as follow:
  - All puctuations were removed
  - All abbreviations are replaced with the complete names
  - Some typoes are fixed
  - All capital letters are converted to lower case letters.
6. The dataset is grouped by `id` and `activity`.
7. The `mean()` function is applied to each groups in the dataset
